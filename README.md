Prime number testing
----
A small Program by Guillaume Simler, more a test for algorythms than anything else.

----
Aim
----
This was rather a game than a real project. It helped me to test some ideas about algorythms. 

I designed a algorythm to give me all prime figures to a given number

----
First Version
----
It is a brute force version. The algorythm checks all new number against all known prime numbers. It also uses a "for - in range()" loop

Time needed until 200 000 (on my desktop): 24,8 s


----
Second Version
----
It is still the brute force version, but uses a "for - in" loop

Time needed until 200 000 : 24,8 s
