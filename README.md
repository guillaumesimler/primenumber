Prime number testing
----
A small Program by Guillaume Simler, more a test for algorythms than anything else.

----
Aim
----
This was rather a game than a real project. It helped me to test some ideas about algorythms. 

I designed a algorythm to give me all prime figures to a given number

----
First Version
----
It is a brute force version. The algorythm checks all new number against all known prime numbers.
